Summary:
  The basic game concept is a mix of Tiny Wings, Luftrausers and Robin Hood. The player plays as a robin (the bird) and must use the hills to propel themselves into the sky, where they can shoot arrows at enemy birds (like blackbirds, because they like taking shiny things!) to make them drop their gold. The player must collect as much gold as they can in a time limit then go back to the start (Sherwood Forest), along the same level. The objective is to gain score/reknown, and complete achievements.

Levels:
  Levels are procedurally generated. The difficulty of each level can be determined by the terrain, number of enemies, number of passive obstacles, availability and scarceness of boosts, and the time limit. The levels could wrap around, making them seamless: This would make it easier for the player to find/return to the start point, and could provide a graphical bonus in showing another part of the level as part of the background (a parallax layer).
